2.We import the data set in which we will work
dataset = read.csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
dataset = dataset[3:5]

   We load the file with the dataset and we indicate that we only want to work with columns from 3 to 5.

3. Encoding the target feature as factor

dataset$Purchased = factor(dataset$Purchased, levels = c(0, 1))

4. Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

library(caTools)
set.seed(123)
split = sample.split(dataset$Purchased, SplitRatio = 0.75)
training_set = subset(dataset, split == TRUE)
test_set = subset(dataset, split == FALSE)


    We load the caTools library, create the seed to randomize the data, divide the data 75% for training and 25% for testing, and create the training and testing subsets.

5. Feature Scaling

training_set[-3] = scale(training_set[-3])
test_set[-3] = scale(test_set[-3])

    scale is generic function whose default method centers and/or scales the columns of a numeric matrix.
    It is used to transform, give scala meaning to data, and help make the algorithm lighter; in this case we indicate that we want to apply the changes to all the columns except the prediction column.
