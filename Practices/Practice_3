2.We import the data set in which we will work

dataset <- read.csv('50_Startups.csv')

3. Encoding categorical data

dataset$State = factor(dataset$State,
                       levels = c('New York', 'California', 'Florida'),
                       labels = c(1,2,3))

    The function factor is used to encode a vector as a factor.
    In other words, the above code is used to transform the values of a text type category to the numeric type; for example, the values of the State category: New York, California and Florida, are changed by labels 1, 2 and 3.
