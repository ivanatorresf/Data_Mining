2.We import the data set in which we will work
  dataset <- read.csv('Salary_Data.csv')

3.We install the Library caTools
Install.packages('caTools)
library(caTools

4 Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
set.seed(123)
split <- sample.split(dataset$Extent, SplitRatio = 2/3)
training_set <- subset(dataset, split == TRUE)
test_set <- subset(dataset, split == FALSE)

Set the seed of Râ€˜s random number generator, which is useful for creating simulations or random objects that can be reproduced.
    sample.split() is used to split the data used during classification into train and test subsets. The following arguments are used:

        Variable with the dataset (dataset) + $ + name of the column to predict (Extent).
        SplitRatio = ratio for dividing the data.
            For example in SplitRatio = 2/3, it means 1/3 of the data will be used for tests and 2/3 for training.

    subset() its a function that allows to select variables and observations. The following arguments are used:

        Variable with the dataset (dataset).
        Condition to be met (split == TRUE).
            In this case, this is where the data that was separated with the previous function will be assigned to the training set.
